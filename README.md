# Statistics

Calculating the regression line:
    1)Calculate the mean and standard Deviation of the dataset.
    2)Calculate the corelation coefficent (1/(n-1))*(product of the sum of x and y Z-scores). r = corelation coefficent
    3)slope of a line = r (sd(y)/sd(x))
    4)finally calculate the y intercept using the mean (x), mean(y) and the slope calculated above. (y = mx + c)
