# Statistics

Calculating the regression line:
  Calculate the mean and standard Deviation of the dataset.
  Calculate the corelation coefficent (1/(n-1))*(product of the sum of x and y Z-scores). r = corelation coefficent
  slope of a line = r (sd(y)/sd(x)
  finally calculate the y intercept using the mean (x), mean(y) and the slope calculated above. (y = mx + c)
